# Unit3Project

### Concept
When exploring the world of artificial intelligence, you may stumble upon a gem known as Conway's Game of Life. It is an example of a simple rule based AI system and is frequently the equivalent of a "TODO" application in AI. <Unit3Project> is designed to teach those interested in learning about rule based AI and allow users to explore different configurations for the simulation.
